# ZBRUSH

The industry standard for digital sculpting and painting

## WHAT’S NEW

<p>
ZBrush is the industry standard digital sculpting software. The latest version features an updated Anchors Brush system which provides an intuitive way to deform meshes by applying anchors onto a mesh while allowing for actions to be performed. The Knife Brushes gain increased design dexterity with a Split to Parts feature set allowing parts to be cut off and retained. Insert Mesh brushes are now compatible with Stroke menu options providing a wild range of visual possibilities. Designing surface details and adding secondary elements to models is now more easily achieved with the Repeat to Similar functionality, and the new DragStamp stroke option helps to advance surface details while buttons like Crease UnMasked and Uncrease UnMasked set the stage for dynamic edge control. The Gizmo and Transpose functions include topology masking for both tools while allowing snapping on perfectly masked areas. The Gizmo is now capable of snapping to the center of masked regions, and the addition of Cinema 4D noises provide robust methods for detailing assets. ZBrush provides access to diverse workflows and limitless creative possibilities.

## BORN IN CLAY

<p>
ZBrush sets the industry standard for digital sculpting and painting. Its features enable you to use customizable brushes to shape, texture and paint virtual clay in a real-time environment that provides instant feedback. When you use ZBrush you'll be empowered by the same tools employed by film studios, game developers, toy/collectible makers, jewelry designers, automotive/aviation designers, illustrators, advertisers, scientists and other artists the world over. In fact, we have even received an Academy Award for the technology that powers ZBrush.
</p>

<p>
In short, ZBrush is an art tool created by artists, for artists. It allows you to create models and illustrations limited only by your imagination, at a speed that allows you to stand out in today's fast paced industry.

## DIGITAL SCULPTING

<p>
Get empowered by the world’s leading digital sculpting solution. The powerful systems inside of ZBrush are designed to eliminate the constraints of traditional modeling and allow you to create freely, just as you would with clay.
</p>

<p>
When you’re ready to move your 3D sculpt into a pipeline for animation, rendering or 3D printing, the tools to do so are at hand.

## PAINTING & TEXTURING

<p>
Because ZBrush works with tens of millions of polygons in real-time, you can paint directly on the surface of the model without first assigning a texture map or UV’s. This offers significant advantages compared to a standard workflow. The resolution of the texture map does not need to be decided in advance. You have the freedom to visualize, explore and create textures in 3D, and in real time.

## READY, SET, RENDER

<p>
Whether you are using ZBrush by itself as an illustration tool or as part of a production pipeline for animation, you will at some point want to show your work to others. ZBrush makes this possible using Redshift, as well as a powerful rendering system called BPR (Best Preview Render).
