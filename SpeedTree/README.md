<p>
SpeedTree 9.5 helps you to bring your environments to life with enhancements in several areas.
</p>

## More creative control:

<p>
With the new frond manipulation feature, you can now randomize and manipulate the fronds of a leaf. By leveraging gravity, wind, and curling features, the fronds come to life, adding a natural touch to your scenes. We have also eliminated the need to jump in and out of other modeling softwares for editing to further streamline the workflow.

## Greater levels of realism:

<p>
SpeedTree 9.5 introduces Projector, a groundbreaking technique for placing procedural details such as moss, snow, and twigs, on model surfaces. Using ray casting technology, these details are efficiently and realistically distributed across large-scale environments. By simulating how these elements would naturally accumulate on surfaces, this feature helps you add a new level of authenticity to scenes and landscapes.

## New techniques for procedural details:

<p>
The new height map support allows you to identify subsections on a mesh via the paint tool in the cutout editor, eliminating the need for external modeling software. This streamlined workflow centralizes creative control so you can stay focused on your artistic vision.
