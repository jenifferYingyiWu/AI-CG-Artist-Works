T5X is a framework for training, evaluation, and inference of sequence models (starting with language). It is based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax). To learn more, see the [T5X Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17189).

# T5X on GPUs

Please refer to [Rosetta T5X](https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox/tree/main/rosetta/rosetta/projects/t5x), NVIDIA's project that enables seamless training of LLMs, CV models and multimodal models in JAX, for information about running models and experiments on GPUs in T5X.
