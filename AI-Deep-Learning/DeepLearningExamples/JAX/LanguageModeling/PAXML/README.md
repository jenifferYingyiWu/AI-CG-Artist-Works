Paxml (aka Pax) is a framework for training LLMs. It allows for advanced and configurable experimentation and parallelization. It is based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Praxis](https://github.com/google/praxis).

# PAXML on GPUs
Please refer to [Rosetta PAXML](https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox/tree/main/rosetta/rosetta/projects/pax), NVIDIA's project that enables seamless training of LLMs, CV models and multimodal models in JAX, for information about running models and experiments on GPUs in PAXML.
